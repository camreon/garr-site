  I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and a Licensed Drug and Alcohol Counselor (LADAC II) in the state of Tennessee. I have worked in outpatient mental health and in inpatient substance use treatment environments. Over my years in the mental health/addiction field I have developed a passion for helping others in the LGBTQ+ community who struggle with issues of trauma, addiction, and developing identity.
