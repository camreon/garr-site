Life can have us feeling stuck and going in circles. It's during these times we may decide we need a place to sit figure out where to go next. As a therapist it has been my honor to walk with individuals during these moments and to witness healing and positive change. Through my experience in the mental health and substance use fields, I have become passionate about helping those in the LGBTQ+ community navigate challenges and transitions specifically those related to trauma and how this effects their relationships with themselves and with others.

As a therapist, I believe a crucial part of my role is to help maintain a safe, engaging space to allow for deep, impacting work to take place. I have found through utilizing psychodynamic and somatic approaches, insight and skills can be developed to help individuals live more freely and authentically.

I welcome the opportunity to sit with you in a welcoming, non-judgemental space and begin a productive therapeutic relationship. If you feel I may be of service to you, please feel free to reach out to me through phone or email.
